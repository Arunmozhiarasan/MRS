Built an AI-driven music recommendation platform tailored for elderly users, focusing on cognitive stimulation, emotional well-being, and reminiscence therapy. The system uses demographic data, genre history, and lyric analysis (via BERT) to curate comforting and familiar music. A simplified web interface ensures ease of use and promotes social engagement, memory recall, and mental health through personalized music therapy. Developed a hybrid music recommendation system that integrates machine learning models with signal processing techniques and BERT-based NLP analysis to personalize music suggestions. The system takes user inputs like age, gender, genre, and artist to recommend songs by analyzing both structured data and audio features such as MFCC, pitch, timbre, and rhythm. Signal processing methods extract relevant acoustic features, while the BERT model analyzes lyrical context to align songs with user mood and preferences. Machine learning algorithms including Decision Tree, KNN, and Random Forest are used for classification, offering culturally and emotionally resonant Tamil music recommendations through a user-friendly web application. This intelligent system enhances user experience by adapting dynamically to individual listening patterns.
